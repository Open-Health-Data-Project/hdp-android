Health Data Tracker is an Android app that allows users to track their data mostly related to (but not limited to) health. That includes actions such as:
* measuring the time of different activities 
* automatic data logging in the background (using smartphone sensors) 
* tracking numeric or categorical data

All of this with the possibility to use only trackers that you want. **Currently app is under development.**
